# R-Type Editor

This is the editor for our game engine library. This basically just lets you you interacts
in a graphical way with the ECS of the engine. In this README you will see how to create a 
project, and how to make a simple game.

If you are familiar with an engine such like Unity, you will find it very similar.

## Creating a project

When launching the editor, you will be greeted with the InitDialog, which asks you to
chose a path to either create or load your project. Once you made your choice, you will
arrive on the main screen of the engine.

## The editor

The editor is separated into several parts.

### The asset explorer

The asset explore works just like a file explorer (but less good). It lets you open, create, and delete files
through the UI.
