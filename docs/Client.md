# Client

## How to run the client ?

First, you must have, in the same place as your client, the files related to the project:
- the project.json
- the assets folder

You now need to create a config file named client.properties
```properties
SERVER_IP=127.0.0.1
SERVER_PORT=4242
```
If this file does not exist, it will be automatically created with these default values.

Lancez ensuite le client et profitez du jeu :)
